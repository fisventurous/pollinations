# FAQ

## 💎 What is Pollen?

Pollen is our prepaid credit system. **$1 ≈ 1 Pollen** *(pricing may evolve)*. You spend it to make API calls.

## 🛒 How do I get Pollen?

There are three ways to add Pollen to your balance:

1.  **Buy It:** Purchase Pollen packs directly with a credit card. This Pollen goes into your wallet and *never expires*. *(Want other payment options? [Vote here](https://github.com/pollinations/pollinations/issues/4826)!)*
2.  **Get Free Pollen Grants:** Once your account is verified, you receive 1.5 Pollen per week (refreshes every Monday at 00:00 UTC). **Creators** — developers actively building apps on Pollinations — earn daily grants instead (seed: 3/day, flower: 10/day, nectar: 20/day), unlocked automatically based on activity.
3.  **Earn It:** Complete one-time community rewards, like helping solve a technical issue or contributing to the project.

## 💳 What payment methods do you accept?

Currently, we accept *credit cards*. We're actively exploring other payment methods based on community feedback.

## 🔑 Can I try it without signing up?

Not currently. You need to register and use an API key to access our models. *All API calls require authentication* and consume Pollen based on the model you use.

## 🎉 What do I get when I register?

Registration gives you access to the Pollinations API and the ability to **create API keys**. New accounts are briefly reviewed — once verified, you receive **1.5 Pollen per week** (refreshes every Monday at 00:00 UTC). You can always purchase Pollen immediately.

- **🌐 Publishable Key (pk\_):** Designed for client-side apps *(bound to your domain)*. Rate limits: 1 pollen per IP per hour. Access to all models, which consume Pollen based on usage.
- **🔒 Secret Key (sk\_):** For server-side apps only. *No rate limits.* Access to all models, which consume Pollen based on usage.

## 🌱 How do Pollen grants work?

Once verified, you receive **1.5 Pollen per week** (refreshes Monday at 00:00 UTC). **Creators** receive daily grants based on their tier (seed: 3/day, flower: 10/day, nectar: 20/day).

Grant Pollen is spent *before* your purchased Pollen. Unused grant Pollen does not carry over (daily grants expire each day, weekly grants expire each Monday).

💚 **Thanks to our supporters**, all users receive free Pollen grants during beta.

## 🎨 What can I create with Pollen?

Think of Pollen like buying in bulk — *the more efficient the model, the more you get!*

**Pro tip:** Mix efficient models for high-volume tasks with premium models when quality matters most.

## ⚡ How is my pollen spent?

Your grant pollen is always used *first*, then your purchased pollen:

1. **Free grants** (weekly or daily) — Used first for most models
2. **Purchased pollen** — Used after grants are depleted

**Exception:** Some premium models are marked with a 💎 **Paid Only** badge. These require purchased pollen and *cannot* use grant pollen. This ensures sustainable access to high-cost models while keeping free grants available for experimentation.

## 👛 How does my Pollen wallet work?

You get *one central Pollen wallet* for all your applications. Top it up anytime and use it across the entire Pollinations ecosystem.

## 🚀 What's coming?

- **🔐 Secure front-end spending:** We are building a solution to allow client-side apps to spend Pollen securely, which will power features like in-app purchases.
- **💰 In-app purchases** — let your users buy Pollen in your app, *you get a bonus*.
- **📺 Ads plugin** — earn Pollen when users see ads.
- **🎬 More models:** Expect video, real-time audio, and an ever-expanding catalog.
- **🏆 Quests:** Earn Pollen by completing community bounties and contributing to projects.
